  "readme": "Heroku client API for node\n==========================\n\nWelcome to this (almost) untested, mostly rip-off of [heroku/heroku.rb](https://github.com/heroku/heroku.rb).\n\nThis module provides exactly the same API as heroku's official client. Each function has been carefully fed\nto monkeys who, through patience and understanding, had been trained to translate basic ruby into coffee \nscript.\n\n<table>\n  <tr><td><img src=\"https://github.com/toots/node-heroku/raw/master/misc/monkey.png\" alt=\"A monkey in action\" title=\"A monkey in action\"/></td></tr>\n  <tr><td>A monkey in action</td></tr>\n</table>\n\nThose monkeys' education cost a lot so we could not afford tests for this code. However, we guarantee that\nno animal was hurt while preparing this module.\n\nHow to use?\n===========\n\nAPI exported by this module is _exactly_ the same as API exported by  [heroku/heroku.rb](https://github.com/heroku/heroku.rb).\nYes, this also means that some variables are not camelCased. We apologize in advance for this inconvenience and,\nmost regretfully, have to deny any liability regarding possible eye injury while inspecting this code.\n\nThat being said, here's a sample use:\n\n    heroku = require(\"heroku\");\n    client = new heroku.Heroku({key: \"deadbeef\"});\n    client.get_releases(\"my_app\", function (error, result) {\n      (...your code here...)\n    });\n\nFor those who prefer to have it with more caffeine, here's the same example in\n[coffee-script](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script):\n\n    {Heroku} = require \"heroku\"\n    client   = new Heroku\n      key : \"deadbeef\"\n\n    client.get_releases \"my_app\", (error, result) ->\n      (..your code here..)\n\n### License\n\nThis code is dual licensed under the Beerware / Lunchware license.  See below for details:\n\n    THE BEER-WARE / LUNCH-WARE LICENSE (Revision 42):\n    <toots@rastageeks.org> wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you\n    can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think\n    this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer and/or lunch in return -- Romain Beauxis\n",
